            It was a rainy night , I was standing infront of a bus counter and
            waiting for my bus. Then I saw a parent with their child standing
            together under a umbrella. There might be a little space , but the
            bond is strong.

            It's a conceptual based photo. In winter I went on a photo-walk with
            CUET Photography Society. The time was around 8 am, there was fog
            all around , a paddy field beside the road. Our main destination was
            that paddy field. On the way I saw this bird was sitting on a wire
            alone.
